# The Rise of Robo Advisors in Investment Management - A Fintech Case Study

## Introduction to Wealthsimple's Robo Advisor

Over the last 30 years, the millenial generation has seen their parent's wealth being deployed in mutual funds by banks & trust companies. Desipte using a combination of active & passive management and hiring finance professionals like CFA's & MBA's to generate optiaml returns, the performance of these investments have been significantly below average on a risk adjusted basis when we compare it with the returns on the broad market indicies like the S&P 500, NASDAQ or the TSX 60. This case study aims to identify and study Wealthsimple's Robo Advisory platform in this emerging market space. 

Robo Advisors have gained popularity in the last 5 years because of a passive investment approach they take which has historically generated greater returns than active management. Since a passive investment strategy is used by robo advisors, the fees charged are significantly lower than a mutual fund offered by a Bank or a Trust company. The investment solutions designed for client's are highly customized to the client's financial need and reduce the need for paperwork & documentation since the program is algo driven.

## Business Activities:

The financial advisory business is facing an impending transformational change. Gen X & Millenial generation are now poised to become the wealthiest demographic once boomers and their parents pass on an estimated 24 trillion dollars. This means the younger, soon-to-be wealthiest will need financial advisors, and they're much more likely to seek that help from algorithm-based robo-advisors than humans.

Before this estimated wealth is passed on the the Gen X & Millenial generations, the current situation is such that this demographics does not have access to access to investment advisory services that are provided by large banks & trust companies due to high account minimum requirements & high fees.

In order to cater to this Gen X & Millenial generation, Wealthsimple provides a samrt & simple way of invsting money and does not rquire a minimum amount for an investment as some tradtional investment managemnt companies would need. The fees charged for investment management is significantly lower due to the passive invetsment approach taken by the firm. Investments are highly customized to the investor needs and are flexible based on changing financial situations. The investment vehicles used are globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, and their cutting-edge technology helps investors earn the best possible return, while optimizing taxes. This means things like automatic rebalancing, dividend reinvesting, and tax loss harvesting â€” services that were only available to the ultra rich until now or that most people found too time-consuming and tedious to do on their own, are now available to everyone.

The one advantage Wealthsimple holds over it's competitors is to provide a variety of low cost investment solutions attributing this to the passive investment approcah taken and the cutting edge technology used in it's algorithms to make portfolio rebalancing cost effective and in a timely manner.

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning is currently being used to assess client financial needs, recommending invetsments based on financial needs and auto rebalancing of these investments.
Robo-advisors do not use a whole lot of AI in their implementation so far. In fact, the majority of them simply automate portfolio strategies that fit with some version of modern portfolio theory (MPT) and build optimized passive indexed portfolios. They then continuously scan and rebalance client portfolios but the investment strategy is not informed by any sort of machine learning. Still, these companies are looking for ways to use AI to enhance MPT through strategies like smart beta investing.
