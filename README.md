# The Rise of Robo Advisors in Investment Management - A Fintech Case Study

## Introduction to Wealthsimple's Robo Advisor

Over the last 30 years, the millenial generation has seen their parent's wealth being deployed in mutual funds by banks & trust companies. Desipte using a combination of active & passive management and hiring finance professionals like CFA's & MBA's to generate optiaml returns, the performance of these investments have been significantly below average on a risk adjusted basis when we compare it with the returns on the broad market indicies like the S&P 500, NASDAQ or the TSX 60. This case study aims to identify and study Wealthsimple's Robo Advisory platform in this emerging market space. 

Robo Advisors have gained popularity in the last 5 years because of a passive investment approach they take which has historically generated greater returns than active management. Since a passive investment strategy is used by robo advisors, the fees charged are significantly lower than a mutual fund offered by a Bank or a Trust company. The investment solutions designed for client's are highly customized to the client's financial need and reduce the need for paperwork & documentation since the program is algo driven.
